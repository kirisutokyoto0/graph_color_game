### 🎨 **How to Play: The Ultimate Graph Coloring Challenge** 🧩

Welcome to **Graph Coloring** – a game that tests your strategic thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. In this game, you’ll need to color the vertices of a graph using a **limited number of colors**. The challenge? **No two adjacent vertices can have the same color**. Are you up for it?

---

#### **📜 Game Objective:**

Your mission is simple: **Color all the vertices** of the graph, but with a twist! You are only allowed to use a specific number of colors. **Make sure no two adjacent vertices share the same color**. It’s all about finding the perfect combination with the limited colors you have!

---

### **🎮 How to Play:**

1. **Start the Game**:
   - The game will display a graph with vertices (points) and edges (connections between the points).
   - Your task is to assign colors to the vertices, but there's a catch: you can only use **a set number of colors**. (For example, 3 colors, 4 colors, etc.)
   - The total number of colors you can use is shown at the start of each level. **Pay close attention to the number of colors you have available!**

2. **Pick a Color**:
   - A color palette will appear on the screen, and you can choose from the available colors. The number of colors you can use is **limited**, so think carefully!
   - **Pick a color first**, then move on to coloring the vertices.

3. **Color the Vertices**:
   - After selecting a color from the palette, **click on a vertex** (node) you want to color.
   - **No two connected vertices** (vertices with an edge between them) can share the same color. If you color a vertex with the same color as a neighboring vertex, **you'll create a conflict**. The game will not alert you, so it's up to you to carefully avoid conflicts as you color the graph.

4. **Check for Conflicts**:
   - As you color the graph, keep a sharp eye on the adjacent vertices. If you accidentally color two connected vertices the same, you’ll have to go back and change one of the colors.
   - The key is to make sure that no two adjacent vertices share the same color — it’s a game of logic and foresight!

5. **Complete the Graph**:
   - Continue coloring the vertices while keeping an eye on the available colors and avoiding conflicts. **Make sure all adjacent vertices have different colors**!
   - If you successfully color all the vertices with no conflicts and within the given number of colors, you **complete the level**. 🎉

### **⚡ Tips for Success:**

- **Start with the most connected vertices**: Look for the vertices that have the most edges (connections). These vertices are the most restricted in terms of colors and should be colored first to help you avoid conflicts later.
  
- **Use the fewest colors possible**: The fewer colors you use, the more challenging the puzzle becomes. Can you color the graph with **just 2 or 3 colors**? The fewer colors you use, the better you’ll get at spotting patterns!

- **Think ahead**: Always think a few moves ahead. Before coloring a vertex, check its neighbors. Plan how you’ll distribute the colors across the entire graph to avoid running into problems later.

- **Undo and retry**: If you get stuck, don’t hesitate to undo a move and try a different strategy. **Every mistake is a chance to learn**!

- **Keep an eye on the color count**: You only have a certain number of colors to work with. Be mindful of how many colors you've already used, and think carefully before using your last remaining color.

### **🏁 Level Up!**

As you progress through the game, the graphs will become more complex, and the number of vertices and edges will increase. You'll need to think smarter and use your colors wisely. The levels get tougher – but can you rise to the challenge? 🔥

### **🎉 Ready to Start?**

The clock is ticking, and the challenge awaits! Dive in and show your coloring skills. Can you conquer each level using only the given number of colors, or will the graph outsmart you?

Good luck, and most importantly – **have fun!** 🧠🎨
